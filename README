Introduction
============

This project was created for the CleanWeb Hackathon 2013 in Beijing.

The goal is to analyze the taxi dataset for find aread with high potential
for pedestrial development.

This program use Spark, a framework distributed computing written in Scala.

Processing
==========

The program goes as as follow:
	a) read the input file
	b) parse the text format into binary format (Sample objects)
	c) filter the events "get in" and "get out" a taxi 
	d) join the consecutive events (get in and get out) into "trip" 
	e) and measure the distance of the trip
	e) filter the trip where of a distance less than 3km.
	f) group the departure points in 10 clusters
	g) for each cluster, print 30 departure (for visualization)

Input will be read from the file sample.csv

Output will be saved into:
	* ./depart.txt/part-XXXX : for the position of the clusters
	* ./groups.txt/part-XXXX : for the points of those clusters


Build
=====

Install sbt (Simple Build Tool) and execute:

	$ sbt package 
	
Run
===
